Project 5 - Fabflix scaling report

Two separate instances were created in AWS and both the instances have separate tomcat and MySQL servers.
First instance( Master Instance - Private IP: 172.31.3.200 Public DNS: ec2-52-40-45-138.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com) is master.
Second instance( Slave Instance - Private IP: 172.31.0.7 public DNS: ec2-54-70-169-166.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com) is slave.

The MySQL instance of slave has been pointed to the last log pointer of master and both has been synced.
All changes made in master will be instantly replicated in slave.

Another instance Load Balancer (Private IP: 172.31.7.119 public DNS: ec2-35-164-203-85.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com) has been created.

Apache server has been installed in Load Balancer instance. The 000-default.conf has been modified to balance the load as given in the example.
For maintaining Session Sticky session has been used in the file.
Also, for redirecting all the urls to modify the database has been directed to master instance only using the proxypass and proxypassreverse.
Hence, the session is maintained and the redirected write requests to master instance only.

The requests are sent through public dns of Load balancer. The balancer correctly uses round robin to connect different requests to different servers.
Sticky session has been checked in logs of the two instances. 
Logged into fabflix and checked if all the requests following it were on the same instance and it worked.

Connection pooling was done the same way as in task 1. Created the context.xml file for each server separately.
For each server connection pooling is done separately.
Connection for first instance have differnt data source as to second.
