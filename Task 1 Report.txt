Project 5 - Connection Pooling Report

Team ID : 01

Team Members: Natarajan Chidhambharam, Sudharshan Arutselvan, Vidhyasagar Thirumaraiselvan


Connection pooling is used in all servlets and JSPs that are creating connection with the MySQL database.

As given in the example, context.xml file containing the details about the MySQL server and login details were created.

Using this context.xml a data source is created in the servelets/JSPs.

The datasource is then used to get the connection.

We replaced all the normal connections we made using drivermanager were replaced with the context reading and connection usign datasource.

Once the connection to the database is not needed the connection is closed so that the next request could be handled using those objects.

We have tried connection pooling in the JSPs too and it seems to work fine.

There seems to be no difference since JSPs are then converted to java files which will do similar work as servlets.

The libraries needed could be imported in JSP and the code when compiled using JASPER gets converted to normal Java code.

Connection pooling thus works in JSPs too.


Files that have used connection pooling:

home.jsp, genre.jsp, result.jsp, cart.jsp, employee.jsp, movie.jsp, stars.jsp.
addMovie.java, chekcout.java, emplogin.java, insertStar.java, login.java, metadata.java, searchBar.java.


Connection Pooling in Task 2:

For task 2 the connection pooling is done separately on both servers.
Different parameters and different sources for each servers.
